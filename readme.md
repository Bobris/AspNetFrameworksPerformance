#ASP.NET Getting Started with ASP.NET Web API

Sample code for post at:
[ASP.NET Frameworks and Raw Throughput Performance](http://www.west-wind.com/weblog/)


This is a small sample project that contains simple HelloWorld and HelloWorldJson 
type requests for several of ASP.NET's frameworks including:

* HttpHandlers
* WebForms
* MVC
* WebPages
* WCF REST
* Web API

It uses Apache's Benchmark tool (ab.exe) to test raw throughput performance
running tests into text files for comparison.
